
Current thing(s) to work on:
- When Users are trying to create a workout, and they add an exercise. Then they try to add another one.
In the table that's displayed in the UI, that exercise is overriden.
I want the user to see the entire workout that they're building
Then once they're done they click "done" and that workout is created.
    - THings to do:
        - Login & Register feature
        - query dynamodb to see if the user has any workouts created
        - make sure that anytime an exercise is created it goes to dynamo (and then it goes to teh UI)
        -

- Login & Register feature (this is for the previous item, because that data will be saved in a dynamo db)
    - Things to do:
        - For this feature, implement it yourself if the user wants to manually register and login using an email address
        & a password

        - Implement cognito if they want to "Sign using Google" or "sign Using Facebook"


Things/Features to do:
- CRUD for workouts
    - Users should be able to view workouts
    - Users should be able to create a workout and view it
    -
